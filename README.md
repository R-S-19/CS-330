My approach to software design usually starts with a comprehensive analysis of the project requirements, which gives me a strong high-level overview of the specifics of what I'm working on. After that's finished, I start assigning tasks to each project component into bucket categories so that work may be distributed later. After that's finished, I get to work on developing the current things. 
When it comes to actually developing the software, I start by creating a working minimal viable product that I can present to my client in order to demonstrate the concept's viability and to seek feedback on how best to personalize the program to each individual user.
Computer science will enable me to support my family with an enjoyable and interesting career, which will help me achieve my goals. I have appreciated the challenge of every course and successfully completing it ever since I began my bachelor's degree at SNHU. In the near future, I hope to work as a software developer in the industry.
